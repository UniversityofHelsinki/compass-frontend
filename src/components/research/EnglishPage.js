                    We, the developers of the Reflection Compass application, are researchers of
                    teaching and learning at the University of Helsinki, Faculty of Educational
                    Sciences. We would like to understand self-evaluation and its accuracy in the
                    context research ethics learning and would like to analyse the match between
                    students’ own understanding of research ethics and the open-ended answers they
                    provide. We are also interested in matches/mismatches between students’ own
                    estimation of their level of understanding of the topic and the teacher’s
                    possible estimation of the students’ level of understanding. We do not analyse
                    the learning tasks given by the teacher.

                    Participation in the research is voluntary. First, we ask the teacher to allow
                    us the use of the information generated through this application. If the teacher
                    consents, the system sends a request to the students of the course. If the
                    teacher declines use of the information generated through the use of the
                    application, the system will not send a request to the students. Information
                    from students who have not consented, will not be used, even if the teacher
                    consented. Participation in research helps us develop research ethics education.

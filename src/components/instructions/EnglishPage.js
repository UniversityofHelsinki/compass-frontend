                    The <i>Reflection Compass</i> application is designed to support teachers in

                    Many courses have elements of research ethics and integrity integrated in them –
                    like research seminars, methodology courses, academic writing, peer reviewing or
                    publishing seminars. In addition, reflection is an important aspect of becoming
                    ethically sensitive. Research ethics and reflection skills may be challenging to
                    evaluate pertaining if and what the students are learning. Moreover, students
                    may rely on AI tools to get assignments done – which is often fine, but if done
                    without own thinking and reflection, it is questionable what students have truly
                    learned. Teachers may wish they could avoid unwanted use of AI and maintain a
                    connection with the students’ learning process without being overloaded with
                    assignments to read.{' '}

                    The application guides the teacher to set up a course with assignments of topics
                    that require student reflection. After setting up the course and assignments (it
                    is a good idea to include several assignments in one course, the assignment time
                    will indicate when students can do them), the teacher then copies an invitation
                    to be shared with students. Teachers can also duplicate their courses and
                    assignments and use them in the coming semesters (courses will have unique IDs
                    that will help distinguish between different years and groups).

                <span lang="en">
                    Students sign in using their credentials and can go to the assignment that the
                    teacher has indicated in the invitation link.  Students do two tasks – they
                    first reflect on the topic indicated in the assignment by writing a paragraph
                    following the task 1 description. After that they read five statements and pick
                    the one that best describes their understanding of the topic they had just
                    reflected on. After submitting their response, they will see automated feedback
                    describing the level of understanding they had picked. The application
                    encourages students to think if the reflection they submitted matches the level
                    of understanding described in the feedback. Students have a chance to go back to
                    their response and edit either their written paragraph or their level of
                    understanding.

                    learning process serves well as a foundation for a subsequent ‘reflection
                    journal’. The graph functions as a prompt for students as they summarise their
                    learning process in the reflection journal. The reflection journal can be used
                    for the purpose of summative assessment, that is, as a graded assignment
                    contributing to the final assessment in the course, usually the grade.{' '}

                    reading the feedback provided by the application and the teacher, can work on

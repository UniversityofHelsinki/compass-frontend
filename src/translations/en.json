    "answer_evaluation_form_header_4": "You have good competencies in research ethics and integrity!",
    "answer_evaluation_form_text_0": "Try to make sense why the topics discussed are relevant. Imagine situations in which you feel empathy or in which you feel you are guided by your values. Why are the values important to you? What would a situation, in which opposite or very different values prevail, be like? What would you do? Considering such questions will help you to think about research ethics and integrity. You can improve your ethical competence by consulting relevant codes of conduct, and to discuss with experienced researchers how they think about making right choices in research; How do they justify their points of view? Why do you think these questions are important for the research community? What is your role in it?",
    "answer_evaluation_form_text_1": "You can still deepen your competencies in research ethics and integrity by consulting relevant codes of conduct and discussing with experienced researchers. Try to grasp more aspects of ethical topics: What else is important or even necessary to make the right choices in research? Who all may be concerned about the situation, and would different people have different views on a situation? What other issues may follow from the current one? Ethical issues in research are often such that there can be related questions, or new questions may follow from the initial issue. Try to map out who all are concerned by a situation, and what kind of different questions they would raise about the situation!",
    "answer_evaluation_form_text_2": "You identify more than one dimension of ethics or integrity in an issue. Next, try to see connections between different ethical aspects in research, and think of examples to describe those connections. Who are concerned about the situation? Do different interests and points of view lead to different solutions? How does an individualâ€™s action influence a group or a community of researchers or even an institution or field? And the other way around: If a group allows for bad research practices to flourish, how does that impact individual researchers and the colleagues they collaborate with? To learn more, you can go over relevant codes of conduct to review principles of good research practice and think about how you can implement good research practice in your own research. What can you do to ensure that your research is up to the highest ethical and integrity standards? Share ideas with others in your group or research community!",
    "answer_evaluation_form_text_3": "You are probably familiar with ethical guidelines and codes of conduct, but you may wish to update your knowledge regularly. Try to extend your knowledge beyond your own research. Find ways to apply your knowledge in various contexts and provide help to others. It is also useful to raise questions in your research group or with colleagues in order to identify how the research ethics of others influence people beyond their group, or what kind of practices support ethical research.",
    "answer_evaluation_form_text_4": "You can manage your own research and ethics, and help others manage theirs. You may have thought quite a lot about research ethics and integrity, perhaps because of your research topic and interests. You can probably recognize ethical issues in research and work on those before they turn into problems. You may have thought about yourself as a role model in promoting good scientific practice in the research community more broadly, and in helping to create an ethically sustainable research culture. Everyone can promote high standards of research ethics and integrity through their own example.",
